## Creating Custom Visuals

If you need custom visuals for your report, consider using these tools:

1. **Diagrams.net (formerly draw.io)**: Free online diagramming tool for creating architecture diagrams
   - URL: https://app.diagrams.net/

2. **Matplotlib (Python)**: For creating custom performance charts
   - Example code for creating a CPU vs GPU performance comparison chart:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

applications = ['Neural Networks', 'Molecular Dynamics', 'Video Processing', 
                'Financial Modeling', 'Medical Imaging']
cpu_performance = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # Baseline
gpu_performance = [45, 25, 10, 35, 20]  # Speedup factors

x = np.arange(len(applications))
width = 0.35

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))
cpu_bars = ax.bar(x - width/2, cpu_performance, width, label='CPU')
gpu_bars = ax.bar(x + width/2, gpu_performance, width, label='GPU')

ax.set_ylabel('Relative Performance')
ax.set_title('CPU vs GPU Performance Comparison')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(applications)
ax.legend()

# Add speedup labels
for i, v in enumerate(gpu_performance):
    ax.text(i + width/2, v + 0.5, f'{v}x', ha='center')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('performance_comparison.png', dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

3. **Blender**: For creating 3D visualizations of complex concepts
