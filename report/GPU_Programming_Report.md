## 1. Introduction to GPU Computing

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were originally designed to accelerate the rendering of 3D graphics. However, their highly parallel architecture makes them exceptionally well-suited for many computationally intensive tasks beyond graphics. This capability, known as General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), has revolutionized numerous fields by providing massive computational power at relatively low cost.

The key advantage of GPUs lies in their parallel processing architecture. While a modern CPU might have 8-32 cores, a GPU can contain thousands of smaller, more specialized cores designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. This parallel architecture makes GPUs ideal for workloads that can be broken down into many independent calculations.

## 2. GPU Architecture Overview

Modern GPUs feature a complex architecture optimized for parallel processing:

- **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**: The building blocks of NVIDIA GPUs, containing multiple CUDA cores
- **CUDA Cores**: Simple processors designed to execute instructions in parallel
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Including global memory, shared memory, and registers
- **Specialized Hardware**: Tensor cores for AI operations and RT cores for ray tracing

The fundamental difference between CPU and GPU architectures is that CPUs are designed for sequential processing with complex control logic and large caches, while GPUs are designed for parallel processing with simpler control logic and higher memory bandwidth.
